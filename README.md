# FlatShareCC_MVVM
 rebuild of FSCC using MVVM WPF pattern
 primary use case: me learning and practicing MVVM

current features:

-create new flat, setup flat with address, area, roomcount, return to flat overview
-edit or delete existing flat
-enter accounting page (no further functionality than to leave accounting page atm.)

-a new flat can have several rooms, if combined area
of rooms exceeds flat area, an error is raised
